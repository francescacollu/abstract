\maketitle

In the last few decades, one of the main purpose of physical research was to develop and employ quantum simulators. Several works have been elaborate, as superconducting circuits with QED cavities, ultracold atoms, quantum fluids of light and systems that use light-matter interaction.\textcolor{red}{[SPECIFY]} These systems can be treated as \emph{open} many-body quantum systems. So, the importance of studying and analyzing this physical field becomes now clear. 

The aim of the study of open systems lies in the master equation that describes the evolution of the system density matrix, here written in the Lindblad formalism:

\begin{equation*}
    \dot{\rho} = -i[H, \rho] - \sum_{a=1}^{N^2-1} \gamma_a \Bigl(\frac{1}{2}L_a^{\dagger}L_a\rho + \frac{1}{2}\rho L_a^{\dagger}L_a - L_a\rho L_a^{\dagger}\Bigl),
\end{equation*}
$N$ being the dimension of Hilbert space.

Solving this equation means treating a number of variables that scales as the square of the dimension of Hilbert space, i.e. even for system with a relatively small size the problem can become unfeasible. Therefore, several numerical techniques have been developed.

In the present thesis, three numerical methods have been studied and analyzed:
the \emph{quantum trajectories} (QT) method, the \emph{corner-space renormalization} (CSR) method and the \emph{matrix product density operator} (MPO) method. Their corresponding algorithms have been implemented\footnote{The algorithm of the MPO method has just been set on parameters of interest.} to investigate some properties of a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XYZ Heisenberg chain coupled at its boundaries to external baths; in particular, the system is driven far from equilibrium with two Lindblad operators chosen in this way:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
    L_1 &= \sqrt{\gamma} \sigma_1^+ \\
    L_2 &= \sqrt{\gamma}\sigma_L^-,
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
$\gamma$ being the dissipation rate. 

The model, representing a chain made up by $L$ sites, is represented by an Hamiltonian of this type:
\begin{equation*}
    H = \sum_{j = 1}^{L-1} J_x\sigma_j^x\sigma_{j+1}^x + J_y\sigma_j^y \sigma_{j+1}^y + \Delta \sigma_j^z \sigma_{j+1}^z,
\end{equation*}
where $J_x$, $J_y$ and $\Delta$ are the coupling constants in x, y, z-direction.

In the present work, an analysis of magnetization profile, spin transport and correlation functions, around the z-direction isotropic point $\Delta = 1$ has been done, for spin chains of length of 8, 16, 32 spins. Simulations have been performed by means of QT, CSR, MPO methods, so that it has been possible to set a numerical benchmark among the available strategies.

The purpose of this dissertation lies in two levels: one is the study of a 1D open quantum system properties, the other is the analysis of limits and advantages of different numerical methods.



%This thesis is focused on the assessment of the performances of the tracking %system (ITk) which
%will replace the current tracker of the ATLAS experiment during the %high-luminosity upgrade of
%the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), scheduled for 2026. \\
%
%LHC has been working at a center-of-mass
%energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 - 8 TeV during Run-1 and at \mbox{$\sqrt{s}$ = 13 %TeV} during Run-2, which started last year. It is scheduled to be upgraded in %two different stages: the 
%first one will begin after the end of Run-2 After the Long Shutdown 2, %scheduled for 2019-2020, LHC will work at
%an energy of 14 TeV, reaching its maximum design value; the second one will %start at
%the end of Run 3 during the Long Shutdown 3 in 2024-2026. The latter stage %will lead
%to what is dubbed as High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) during which the 
%instantaneous luminosity will reach the maximum value of $7.5 \times 10^{34}$ %cm$^{-2}$ s${^{-1}}$, corresponding to approximately 3000 fb$^{-1}$ over ten %years of data taking. \\
%
%The increase of the instantaneous luminosity will cause the average number of %proton-proton interactions per bunch crossing (``pile-up'' events) to reach %the value $\langle\mu\rangle$ = 200, which 
%is about 10 times the current one ($\langle\mu\rangle$ = 23). By the end of %Run-3, ATLAS detector will be using \mbox{15-20 years old} components. In %particular, the pixel and strip sensors of the current Inner Detector will %have reached the end of their lifetime, while the Transition
%Radiation Tracker will not be able to withstand the harsh conditions imposed %by HL-LHC. Thus,
% the Inner Detector must be completely replaced by the Inner Tracker (ITk), %which will have
% to guarantee the same or an improved performance during that phase.\\
%
%Due to the large number of pile-up events, the time required by the Monte %Carlo simulations 
%is extremely high, making it difficult to produce samples with large %statistics. In this thesis,
%a fast simulation method that significantly decreases the time required by the %simulation while
%allowing to simulate the effect of the high number of pile-up events on the %tracking
%and physics performances was developed. The idea is to limit the simulation to %specific regions of interest, excluding a considerable part of the generated %event. While the idea was inspired
%from previous works, we extended the use of this technique to samples %containing physics 
%processes.\\
%
%At the moment, the ATLAS Collaboration is working on the design of a robust %ITk layout (with extended angular coverage with respect to the current Inner %Detector) 
% which will be able to perform adequately in the high-luminosity conditions. A %fast simulation method is particularly useful as we want to quickly compare, %in a realistic scenario, different detector designs and layouts. In this %thesis, the performances of three ITk layouts are compared both from the %point of view of the track reconstruction capabilities, which have been %explored by considering single particle samples with either charged pions or %muons, and 
%from the point of view of the physics performances, in the $H \rightarrow %ZZ^{*} \rightarrow 4\mu$ channel. In fact, 
% as Higgs physics is of the utmost importance, it is useful to check our %capability to perform
% well in the high pile-up environment. \\
% 
%Results obtained in this thesis showed that the layouts proposed 
%are robust, as no significant dependence of the performance on the pile-up %scenario (up to $\langle\mu\rangle$ = 200) was observed. Also, the three %layouts respect the requirements fixed by the Collaboration on the expected %track parameters resolution in the central
%region. Our work shows also that, while no clear choice among the different %layouts can be drawn at this stage, the extension of the angular coverage up %to $|\eta| = 4.0$ will provide the Higgs studies with better statistics. A %signal-to-background radio of at least 7 can be obtained in the $H \rightarrow %ZZ^{*} \rightarrow 4\mu$ channel alone, with an estimated experimental %$\Delta\mu/\mu$ of about 2.5\%  (before inclusion of luminosity uncertainty) %for the various layouts, which is very close to the requirement of the %Collaboration.
